git workflow:

Check which branch you are on:
$ git branch

If not on master, check out master:
$ git checkout master

Pull:
$ git pull origin master

Make a branch for the new feature you want to work on:
$ git branch feature_my_new_idea
$ git checkout feature_my_new_idea

Check if you are on feature_my_new_idea:
$ git branch

Write code and commit often. Write a test for your code and include it in "make test". The test should first fail to be sure it works. Use --no-verify to commit with failing tests
$ git commit -a -m --no-verify "Implemented my new idea, does not work yet"
$ git commit -a -m "Implemented my new idea, it works"

When it works, merge back into master:
$ git checkout master
$ git pull origin master
$ git merge feature_my_new_idea
$ make test

If the master code works, push it:
$ git push origin master

Start over with a NEW feature branch.
