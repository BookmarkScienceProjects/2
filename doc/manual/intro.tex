\subsection{Installing and running \mumax}

After unpacking the \mumax binaries, the program can immediately be use by running the command \cmd{mumax2}. It is recommended to add the \mumax executables to your PATH by adding this line to the end of your \file{.bashrc} file:
\shell{export PATH=\$PATH:/home/me/mumax2/bin}
